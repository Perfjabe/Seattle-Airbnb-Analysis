📊 Findings & Insights

1️⃣ Pricing Adjustments Needed

✅ Use dynamic pricing to reduce winter vacancies and maximize summer revenue.
✅ Luxury listings should reconsider pricing as ultra-expensive options struggle with demand.

2️⃣ Neighborhood-Specific Strategies

✅ Lower prices or adjust offerings in high-vacancy areas (e.g., Industrial District, Roxhill).
✅ Increase pricing or listings in high-demand areas (e.g., Portage Bay, Interbay).

3️⃣ Budget-Friendly Options Drive Engagement

✅ Listings under $100 attract more guests and reviews.
✅ New hosts should price competitively in high-demand locations.

4️⃣ Marketing & Listing Optimization

✅ Broadway & International District have many listings but high vacancies – better marketing needed.
✅ Offer discounts for long-term stays in off-peak months.

📌 Booking & Availability Trends

1️⃣ High Vacancy in Some Areas

🔹 100% availability year-round in the Industrial District – almost no bookings.
🔹 Other high-vacancy areas: Roxhill, Rainier View, Briarcliff.

🛠 Takeaway:

High availability may mean overpricing or poor marketing.

Hosts should adjust pricing or improve listings.

2️⃣ Seasonal Demand & Peak Booking Months

🔹 Peak season: May – September (high occupancy).
🔹 Slow season: November – January (high vacancies).

🛠 Takeaway:

Summer = higher prices. Winter = lower prices or discounts for long-term stays.

📌 Pricing & Neighborhood Trends

3️⃣ Flat Pricing Strategy

🔹 Avg. price = $171.4, stays the same all year.
🔹 Winter prices are high despite low demand.

🛠 Takeaway:

Hosts should adjust prices based on demand trends.

4️⃣ Oversupply of Listings in Some Areas

🔹 Most listings in: Broadway, Belltown, University District.
🔹 Fewest listings in: Industrial District, Holly Park, Rainier View.

🛠 Takeaway:

High-competition areas need better pricing/marketing.

Underserved areas might be an opportunity for new listings.

5️⃣ Luxury Listings Struggle

🔹 High-end listings ($3,000+) have low engagement.
🔹 Lower luxury tiers ($1,000-$2,000) perform slightly better.

🛠 Takeaway:

Seattle has low demand for ultra-luxury listings. Hosts may need to reposition pricing or improve amenities.
